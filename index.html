                <div class= "texto"> The exercise involved in most sports improves teens’ health, strength, emotional balance, and life years. Exercise releases cortisol, which reduces stress; and endorphins, our bodies’ natural feel-good chemicals. Sports participation is linked to reduced heart disease and diabetes, among other health benefits. The best way your teen can maintain a healthy weight is to eat a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, no-fat or low-fat milk products, beans, eggs, fish, nuts, and lean meats. Eating healthfully means getting the right balance of nutrients. As your teen grows, he or she will require more calories and an increase of key nutrients including protein, calcium, and iron. Your teen should drink mainly water and low-fat or fat-free milk. Think of soda and artificially sweetened fruit juices as desserts or treats and reserve them for special occasions. They may be tasty but they are full of empty calories. It's recommended to look for professional help to lose height, but if you want to have a ideia what's a diet plan looks like, take a look:
